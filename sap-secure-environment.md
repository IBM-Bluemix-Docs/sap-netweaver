Firewalls help prevent unwanted traffic from hitting your server, help reduce your attack vulnerability, and lets your server resource be dedicated for its use. You can choose a shared firewall, dedicated firewall, or the [Fortinet FortiGate security appliance](/docs/fortigate-10g?topic=fortigate-10g-getting-started) based on your specific performance and feature requirements.

For more information on the firewalls offered by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, see [Getting Started Hardware Firewall (Shared)](/docs/hardware-firewall-shared?topic=hardware-firewall-shared-getting-started), and for guidance on how to set up a dedicated firewall, see [Getting Started Hardware Firewall (Dedicated)](/docs/hardware-firewall-dedicated?topic=hardware-firewall-dedicated-getting-started).
