{: #secure_environment}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} offers firewalls that can provide your {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} with a layer of security that is provisioned on demand and designed to eliminate service interruptions.

Firewalls help prevent unwanted traffic from hitting your server, help reduce your attack vulnerability, and lets your server resource be dedicated for its use. You can choose a shared firewall, dedicated firewall, or the [Fortinet FortiGate security appliance](docs/infrastructure/fortigate-10g?topic=fortigate-10g-getting-started) based on your specific performance and feature requirements.

For more information on the firewalls offered by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, see [Getting Started Hardware Firewall (Shared)](docs/infrastructure/hardware-firewall-shared?topic=hardware-firewall-shared-getting-started), and for guidance on how to set up a dedicated firewall, see [Getting Started Hardware Firewall (Dedicated)](docs/infrastructure/hardware-firewall-dedicated?topic=hardware-firewall-dedicated-getting-started).
