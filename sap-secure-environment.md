Firewalls help prevent unwanted traffic from hitting your server, help reduce your attack vulnerability, and lets your server resource be dedicated for its use. You can choose a shared firewall, dedicated firewall, or the [Fortinet FortiGate security appliance](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/infrastructure/fortigate-10g/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-fortigate-security-appliance-10gbs) based on your specific performance and feature requirements.

For more information on the firewalls offered by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, see [Getting Started Hardware Firewall (Shared)](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/infrastructure/hardware-firewall-shared/getting-started.html#getting-started), and for guidance on how to set up a dedicated firewall, see [Getting Started Hardware Firewall (Dedicated)](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/infrastructure/hardware-firewall-dedicated/getting-started.html#getting-started).
