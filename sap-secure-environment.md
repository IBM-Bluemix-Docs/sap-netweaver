Firewalls help prevent unwanted traffic from hitting your server, help reduce your attack vulnerability, and lets your server resource be dedicated for its use. You can choose a shared firewall, dedicated firewall, or the [Fortinet FortiGate security appliance](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/infrastructure/fortigate-10g/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-fortigate-security-appliance-10gbs) based on your specific performance and feature requirements.

Visit [Introduction to Hardware Firewall](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/learning/introduction-hardware-firewall) for information on the firewalls offered by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, and see [Configure a Hardware Firewall (Dedicated)](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/procedure/configure-hardware-firewall-dedicated) for guidance on how to set up a dedicated firewall.
