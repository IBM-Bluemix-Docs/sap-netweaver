# 3. Determining your SAP NetWeaver applications

Your business and functional requirements determine the SAP solutions to run on top of the SAP NetWeaver stack. Your requirements have an influence on how you size your server. There is a wide selection of SAP NetWeaver-based applications from which to choose, including SAP ERP Central Component (ECC), SAP S/4HANA Business Suite, and customer engagement and commerce solutions. Items to consider when making your determination include:

  * How do you intend to use the applications? Is the intended use for development and testing, or production?
  * Do you use an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Virtual Private Network service-SSL or Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)?
