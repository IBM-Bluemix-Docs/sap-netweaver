# 1. Getting SAP and IBM Cloud credentials and create accounts
{: #get_sap_ibm_credentials}

The following steps provide guidance on how to obtain the necessary credentials for SAP and {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}.
{: shortdesc}

## SAP credentials and accounts for new users
{: #sap_credentials}

1. Set up an account on the [SAP home page ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.sap.com/){: new_window} and follow the instructions.

## {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} credentials and accounts for new users
{: #ibm_credentials}

1. Go to [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/get-started){: new_window} and click **Get started free**.

   You will receive an email from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support containing your verification code, from which you can create your initial login ID and password.

2. Set up your [profile](/docs/account?topic=account-usersettings#profile-photo) to log in as a new user.

You can [create other accounts](/docs/customer-portal?topic=customer-portal-getting-started#getting-started) and [create new users](/docs/customer-portal?topic=customer-portal-getting-started#users-permissions) after you have received your login credentials, and you have connectivity to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network.
