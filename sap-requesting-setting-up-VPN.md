# 1. Requesting IBM Cloud VPN connectivity
{: #request_vpn_connect}

Work with [{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Support](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/get-support/howtogetsupport.html#getting-customer-support) to obtain your access to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Virtual Private Network (VPN) if you plan to turn off your public port or provision your machine as private only. After you have created your users, you can assign them VPN access to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network if using one of the production-level VPN options.

See [Getting started with Virtual Private Network](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/infrastructure/iaas-vpn/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-virtual-private-networking-vpn-) for steps on how to set up VPN access.
