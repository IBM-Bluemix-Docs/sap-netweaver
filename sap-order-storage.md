# 1. Ordering storage
{: #order_storage}

{{site.data.keyword.blockstoragefull}}, {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_full_notm}}, and Network Attached Storage (NAS) are ordered after you deploy your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}.

## Ordering {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} storage
{: #ibm_storage}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} storage LUNS ({{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}}) and volumes ({{site.data.keyword.filestorage_full_notm}}) can be provisioned with two options - Endurance and Performance. Endurance tiers feature pre-defined performance levels and other features, such as [snapshot](/docs/infrastructure/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-snapshots) and replication. A custom Performance environment is built with allocated input/output/operations per second (IOPS) between 100 and 1,000.

[Getting started with Block Storage](/docs/infrastructure/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-getting-started) and [Getting started with File Storage](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage?topic=FileStorage-getting-started) provides you with provisioning considerations, how to submit your order (if you didn't order when you originally provisioned your server), and connecting to and managing your new storage.

The *SAP NetWeaver Quick Reference Guides (for Microsoft Windows* or *for Red Hat Enterprise Linux*) take you through a complete server configuration and deployment, including ordering {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} and iSCSI configuration steps based on a sample deployment for Linux and Windows.

For VMware ESXi, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} storage type can be used as data stores; in which case, it is mapped to ESXi as an iSCSI device. Follow the steps in [Mounting iSCSI VMware ESXi](/docs/infrastructure/vmware?topic=VMware-mount-iscsi-esxi#mount-iscsi-esxi) to map iSCSI devices to ESXi.
