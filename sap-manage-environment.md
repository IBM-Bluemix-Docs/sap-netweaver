# Managing your SAP NetWeaver environment
{: #manage_environment}

Managing your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} environment includes ordering your storage (block, file, or network attached), securing it, optionally installing a guest OS on the VMware hypervisor, downloading and installing your SAP NetWeaver software and applications, and testing your connectivity to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data center.

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin}

First, navigate to the device menu, and ensure you have the correct account permissions to complete the tasks.

* Navigate to your console's device menu. For more information, see [Navigating to devices](/docs/infrastructure/sap-netweaver?topic=virtual-servers-navigating-devices).
* Ensure you have any necessary account permissions and device access. Only the account owner, or a user with the **Manage Users** classic infrastructure permission, can adjust the permissions.

Table 1 contains hyperlinks to help you through the management process.
