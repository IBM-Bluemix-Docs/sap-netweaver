# 4. Downloading and installing SAP software and applications
{: #install_sap}

Log in to the [SAP Service Marketplace](https://websmp201.sap-ag.de/) and download the required digital versatile discs (DVDs) to a local share drive that is visible to the private {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network. You can either download each DVD or use the [SAP Download Manager](https://support.sap.com/software/download-manager/help.html). If you are using the SAP Download Manager, download it to an on-premise machine and transfer it to your SAP NetWeaver server. 

After you connect to the SAP Marketplace, you can choose the SAP software components to download through the [SAP Download Basket](https://websmp210.sap-ag.de/~sapidp/002006825000000233112001/).

After downloading the installation media, follow the standard SAP installation procedure documented in the [SAP installation guide](https://service.sap.com/instguides) for your SAP version and components and the corresponding [SAP Notes](https://support.sap.com/notes). The installation guide and SAP Notes require an SAP S-user ID.
