# Bring your own license

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} for SAP Applications offering is bring your own license (BYOL); you need to apply the corresponding license for your SAP products after installation. If you are new to SAP, start exploring under [SAP All Products](https://www.sap.com/products.html){: new window}. You can also contact SAP Sales or SAP Support for details on how to obtain  the required licenses.

If you purchased your SAP and {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} Linux, Unix, and Windows (LUW) licenses as part of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM)/application specific licensing (ASL) agreement, you can download and apply license files from the [SAP Service Marketplace](https://websmp201.sap-ag.de/){: new window}. See [SAP Note 816773-DB6](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/816773){: new window}: Installing an SAP OEM license for more information. However, if you purchased {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} LUW from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} or an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Business Partner, you must use the license files that are provided by your vendor instead.
