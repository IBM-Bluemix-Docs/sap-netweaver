See [SAP Note 816773-DB6](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/816773){: external}: Installing an SAP OEM license for more information. However, if you purchased {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} LUW from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} or an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Business Partner, you must use the license files that are provided by your vendor instead.
