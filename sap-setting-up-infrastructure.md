# 2. Setting up your infrastructure
{: #set_up_infrastructure}

The guidance for setting up your SAP NetWeaver {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_long}}, network, security, storage, and operating system (OS) are in the following section. Contact [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support#getting-customer-support) with any questions.

## Ordering your server
{: order-server}

You have two options to get to provision your {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}. The first is through the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console](#using-console) and the second is through the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](#using-portal). The console and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} infrastructure customer portal require unique log-in IDs, which is an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}id. Use the following steps to order your {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}. Additional information can be found under [Building a custom bare metal server](/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-ordering-baremetal-server#ordering-baremetal-server).

## Provisioning your {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console
{: #using-console}

1. Log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external} with your unique credentials.
2. Click **Create resource** > **Compute** > **Bare Metal Server** > **Continue**.
3. Enter the number of servers you are ordering in the **Quantity** field and select your **Location**, which is your data center.
4. Click **All servers** > **SAP certified**. SAP NetWeaver-certified servers are identified with **-NW** under CPU Model.

The BI.S3.NW32 (OS Options) server is also available for **Hourly** billing.
{: note}

   The Red Hat-based server configuration is described in step 7 and step 1 under [Selecting your server options](#select_options); the steps are the same for Microsoft Windows. Note that for VMWare, your choice is limited, however, the steps are the same.

   Here's an example on how to decipher the SAP NetWeaver server names.

| Server name | Naming convention component | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BI.S3.NW768 | BI | Bluemix Interface |
| | S3 | Series 2 (processor generation) |
| | | S1 is Ivy Bridge/Haswell |
| | | S2 is Broadwell |
| | | S3 is Skylake/Kaby Lake |
| | NW | NetWeaver-certified server |
| | 768 | Amount of RAM |

5. Select the appropriate SAP HANA-certified server for your workload.
6. **Server**, **RAM**, and your private storage option default based on your server selection and cannot be changed. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} or {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_full_notm}}, and Network Attached Storage (NAS) are ordered after you have ordered your server.
7. Select your **Operating System** from either Red Hat or SUSE and select the specific operating system, or VMware hypervisor for your server.

If you are bringing your own license (BYOL) for your operating system, select **Other** > **No Operating System**. For more information, see [Bring your own license](#byol).
{ :note}

## Provisioning your {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} using the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}
{: #using-portal}

1. Log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure customer portal](https://control.softlayer.com){: external} with your unique credentials.
2. Click **Account** > **Place an Order** on the Account Summary page.
3. Click the **Monthly** link under {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} on the Devices page. SAP NetWeaver-certified servers are identified with **-NW** under CPU Model. 

The BI.S3.NW32 (OS Options) server is also available for **Hourly** billing.

## Selecting your server options
{: #select_options}

In the next step, you will select the type and number of disks you want to add to your configuration. You can also select different options for Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) storage groups and partitioning layouts on-top of the RAID storage groups. See [About RAID](docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-raid-levels) or [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support#getting-customer-support) for more information.

1. Under **SAP Certified Servers**, make your selection based on how you plan to use your server. Consult the [Design Decision Tool](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/infrastructure-design-decision-tool){: external} or [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support#getting-customer-support) for more information
2. Click the **Add to order** button at the bottom of the page.

## Setting up Advanced System Configurations
{: #adv_config}

1. Follow the [Advanced System Configuration](/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-ordering-baremetal-server#ordering-baremetal-server) guidelines for help with the values in the **Advanced System Configuration** window.

SAP Hostnames must consist of a maximum of 13 alpha-numeric characters. See [SAP Notes 611361](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/611361){: external} and [129997](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/129997){: external} for more SAP Hostname details.

If you have decided on a public/private setup for your environment and plan to
  * Install multiple SAP systems that need to communicate with each other *or*
  * Choose a three-tier SAP setup (database and application instances on different hardware)

Make sure that your name resolution reflects the internal and external addresses. The external address matches the hostname of the server resolved by its fully-qualified domain name (FQDN).

The internal addresses will not appear in the domain name system (DNS). Since internal IPs should be used for communication between the servers, make sure you extend your `/etc/hosts` or Microsoft Windows "host" file accordingly. This information might also apply to the guest operating system of you VMware ESXi-based deployments.

## Confirming your selections
{: #confirm_selections}

1. Confirm your selections on the Checkout page and click the **Cloud Service terms** and **3rd Party Software Agreement** checkboxes.
2. Scroll down to Create Account: Enter Billing and enter the **Payment Type, Name, Card** and **Expiration** (date) for the credit card to be used for billing.
3. Click the **Submit Order** button. You are redirected to a screen with your order number. You can print the screen, because it is also your order receipt.

A confirmation email with the subject Your _{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Order ## has been approved_ is be sent to the email address in your profile. This email is notice that your server has been approved and is in the process of being deployed. After it is deployed, another notice is sent notifying you that the server is available and can be managed through the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external} or the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure customer portal](https://control.softlayer.com){: external}.

## Bring your own license
{: #byol}

When you have your own operating system license, you install it on your {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} based on the vendor's instructions. For more information, see [The no OS option](/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-no-os#bm-no-os).

## Next Steps
{: #setting-up-infrastructure-next-steps}

You are now ready to begin Managing your {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}. See [Managing your SAP NetWeaver environment](/docs/infrastructure/sap-netweaver?topic=sap-netweaver-manage_environment#manage_environment) for your next steps.
